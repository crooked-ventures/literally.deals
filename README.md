> "Those sure are some deals that exist."

`literally.deals` is a Python web app that finds random discounted products on Amazon. Since Amazon's product API doesn't actually give any way to do this, the app uses the [Letterpress word list](https://github.com/atebits/Words) to search in random Amazon product categories until it finds one or more items that are discounted, then returns one out of the top ten products.
